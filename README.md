# GB Playbook (guildball.app)

GB Playbook is an app to assist playing the Guild Ball tabletop game.  It's
primary focus is on ease of use for model health tracking while playing, and
up-to-date access to profile cards.

Guild Ball is a product of Steamforged Games.  
GB Playbook is an independent, fan created app.

GB Playbook was created to have a mobile tracking app that would support the
Guild Ball Community Project errata and new model releases, and will continue
to support future rules updates from Steamforged Games and/or the Guild Ball
Community Project.

Since August 2023 GB Playbook is delivered as a mobile-focused web app at
guildball.app, replacing older versions distributed through mobile app stores.

## Installation

GB Playbook can be use directly in a browser at
[guildball.app](https://guildball.app), or can be installed for a standalone app
experience.  It's highly recommended to install on a mobile device, which will
enable a full-screen app experience and provide offline access to most
functionality and the Guild Ball rulebook PDF.

### Android Installation
Most android browsers should offer to install GB Playbook when visiting
guildball.app.  
You can also check the browser menu for "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"
options.

GB Playbook is also available in the Google Play store.  This is now just a
"trusted web activity" launcher around the guildball.app, and is not different
then installing from the browser.

### iOS Installation
Safari does not prompt the user to install web apps, but the following steps
can be followed.
- open guildball.app in Safari
- tap the "share" icon
- select "Add to home screen" from the sharing menu

### Fire tablets / other Android devices
Fire tablets, and other Android devices that do not support installing web apps
from the browser, can install GB Playbook from the Google Play store (if you've
set that up).

An APK for side-loading is also available on
